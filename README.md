# 3d things with ThreeJS

Early in 2020 I became a little obsessed with learning ThreeJS for fun. I played around and tried to learn the library and build fun little pages. This page is a compilation of my three favorite projects - my grandma's Christmas card, skyboxes, and a little solar system. All of them can be moved around and zoomed into :)
